# site_blocker
A simple browser extension to block some addictive sites

I was reluctant to download a blocker from the chrome extension store: you never know what you install, and I did not want to spend the time examining their code. 

Written in about 5 min with chatGPT. Putting it here for future me. 

# Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/qbalin/site_blocker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the site_blocker repo and unzip it locally
2. Tweak the file background.js to block the sites you don't want to access anymore. Or learn self restraint, and just trash the zip and the folder. ðŸ§˜
3. In a chromium browser, got to the extension page: chrome://extensions
4. In the top right, tick "Developer mode"
5. In the top left "Load unpacked"
6. Select the unzipped folder
7. Sites are blocked!
